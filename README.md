# WEEK-1

# smart-ev-battery-health-infra-opt
Build a smart system to optimize electric vehicle (EV) battery health and charging infrastructure using charging session data, machine learning, and advanced analytics.

# Problem Statement
Develop, train, and deploy machine learning models to:
Predict EV battery degradation and health over time based on charging habits, usage, vehicle specs, and environmental factors.
Optimize charging infrastructure placement and route planning using charging load, wait times, and regional demand patterns.
Provide actionable recommendations for EV users and infrastructure planners to extend battery life, reduce costs, and efficiently allocate resources.

# Dataset
Dataset Name: EV charging Load Dataset and Optimal Routing

# Source: Kaggle

# Next Steps
Data exploration and preprocessing
Feature engineering and exploratory analysis
Building and evaluating ML models for:
Battery health prediction
Charging demand and station utilization forecasting
Route and station placement optimization
Visualization of results (e.g., battery health trends, optimal charging maps)
Building an interactive app (using Streamlit) for recommendations and scenario analysis
